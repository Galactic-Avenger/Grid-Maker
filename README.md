# Grid-Maker
This is the main repository for The Grid-Maker Website Project.

## Project-Overview
The Grid Maker  is a group-based interactive website that allows users to create and manipulate a grid of cells. By clicking menu buttons, users can add or remove rows and columns on the fly. They can also choose a color from a dropdown menu to fill or clear the cells in various ways either one cell at a time, all uncolored cells, or the entire grid. This functionality demonstrates core web development concepts taught in the class such as HTML for structure (home and grid pages, the table, menu buttons) CSS for styling (default cell appearance, home and grid maker pages design) JavaScript for DOM manipulation and event handling (adding/removing rows and columns, applying & clearing colors).
